We're almost there! To complete the game, go back and cd to RoomThree from Learning Center. Locate the homer.txt , which will contain a listing of your home directory. Create it by the running the following command:

ls -l ~ > homer.txt


This command creates a listing of the contents in your home directory and saves it to homer.txt.
After this, navigate back to the RoomThree directory in LearningCenter. Locate the runme.sh file. Make the file executable by running the following command:

chmod +x runme.sh 


Once you do this, you'll be able to execute the script by entering:

./runme.s

There, you'll recieve your final instructions.
