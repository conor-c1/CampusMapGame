We're almost there! To complete the game, go back to RoomThree and make the runme.sh file executable by running the following commands:

chmod +x runme.sh

Then verify and run the script by typing:

./runme.sh 


Then locate the homer.txt in the same RoomThree directory. This file contains a listing of your home directory. To create it, run the following commands: 

ls -l ~ > homer.txt
