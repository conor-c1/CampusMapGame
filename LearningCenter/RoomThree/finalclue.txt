Congratulations! We found our class in time! To complete the game, go back and cd to RoomThree from Learning Center. Locate the FinalDestination directory and find the homer.txt , which will contain a listing of your home directory. Create it by the running the following command:

ls -l ~ > homer.txt


This command creates a listing of the contents in your home directory and saves it to homer.txt.
After this, navigate back to the RoomThree directory in LearningCenter. Find the FinalDestination directory again and locate the runme.sh file. Make the file executable by running the following command:

chmod +x runme.sh 


Once you do this, you'll be able to execute the script by entering:

./runme.s

Then, navigate back the top directory, CampusMap, and create an empty file called victory.txt. Do this by running:

touch victory.txt

Then, to stage your changes, use:

git add . 

Commit the changes using:

git commit -m "I am victorious"

Finally, push the changes to Github by running:

git push
