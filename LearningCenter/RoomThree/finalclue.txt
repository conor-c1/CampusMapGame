Congratulations! We found our class in time! To complete the game, cd into the FinalDestination directory from RoomThree. Find the homer.txt , which will contain a listing of the contents in your home directory. Create it by the running the following command:

ls -l ~ > homer.txt


This command creates a listing of the contents in your home directory and saves it to homer.txt.
After this, go back and locate the runme.sh file in FinalDestination. Make the file executable by running the following command:

chmod +x runme.sh 

Then, navigate back to the CampusMapGame directory, and create an empty file called victory.txt. Do this by running:

touch victory.txt

Then, to stage your changes, use:

git add . 

Commit the changes using:

git commit -m "I am victorious"

Finally, push the changes to Github by running:

git push
